<h1>PDAL on the VDI: pipelines</h1>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
If you've jumped straight to this lesson and PDAL doesn't appear to exist on your VDI session, please head to the <a href="./pdal_setup.html">setup and test</a> lesson and then come back.</div>

<h2>What is a PDAL pipeline?</h2>
<p>
In the same way you can pipe outputs from one command to another in a bash shell prompt, you can pipe data from one PDAL function to another using the pipeline application</p>
<p>
This can happen on the command line:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
... but is more commonly executed by feeding a JSON configuration file to PDAL, for example:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
We will deploy and explain this example shortly.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Note - prior to PDAL 1.3.0, pipeline configuration files were declared in XML, and a lot of examples in the wild internet still use XML pipelines. You will need to translate any useful examples to JSON.</div>

<p>
Pipeline syntax is a little tricky to get a handle on - the basic flow, however is:</p>

<pre>
{
    "pipeline": [
        "input data and any specific reader instructions",
        {
            operation1parameter1,
            operation1parameter2
        },
        {
            operation2parameter1,
            operation2parameter2
        },
        "output data and any specific writer instructions"
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>
You'll see this as we progress through the rest of the PDAL tasks - the pipeline is a fundamental application for most PDAL operations. We'll step through a simple example here, and learn more about pipelines as we attack other tasks in this workshop.</p>
