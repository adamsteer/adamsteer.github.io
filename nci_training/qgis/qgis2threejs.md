# Exploratory data analysis and visualisation using QGIS

## In this exercies
    
- How to use **QGIS** (http://qgis.org) as a tool for interacting with data using web data services and on the VDI filesystem
- Obtaining data from a Web Coverage Service (WCS)
- Obtaining data from a web-based vector data service
- Obtaining data from the NCI file system using the NetCDF Operators (NCO)
- Using QGIS to fuse data and create a shareable, interactive 3D map rendered using webGL in a browser

We are going to make an interactive version of the map below, starting with data from three different sources merged using QGIS. We will also see some key differences between data access methods.\n",
