				    <h3>Why - part 1</h3>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    The formation of sea ice on the southern ocean provides salty cold water to drive oceanic overturning circulation.</p>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    When present, sea ice interferes with ocean/atmosphere heat exchange - acting as an insulator</p>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    Sea ice interferes with the exchange of momentum between the ocean and atmosphere. Its drift also transports fresh water from the site of ice formation to the site of ice melt</p> 
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    Sea ice provides a unique winter habitat for life in the southern ocean, and its melt contributes to spring plankton blooms</p>

				    <p>
				    The thickness distribution of Antarctic sea ice is a key measure of the magnitude of all these effects.</p>
				    <p>
				    <b>but:</b><br />
				    The thickness distribution of Antarctic sea ice is very dynamic, and very poorly described. Its variability at floe to sub-floe scales is unknown.</p>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <h3>Why - part 2</h3>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    Circumpolar sea ice thickness distribution monitoring is really only feasible using satellite instruments, and the only instruments which are so far practial are altimeters - for example ICESat/GLAS, or CryoSAT-2</p>
				    <aside class="notes">
				    Why only altimeters? because imagers don't tell us anything about the 3rd dimension, and there are no spaceborne ice-penetrating instruments. Ice/snow height above 'sea level' is pretty much all we can measure from that far away
                    </aside>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    ...but sea ice is highly variable at sub-100m scales - which satellite altimeters cannot (yet) detect</p>
				    <aside class="notes">
				    ICESat-2 should be able to detect sub-100m features, due for launch soon. One issue to resolve is the penetration of the ICESat-2 LiDAR through snow and water.

				    Orange circles represent ICESat 'spots' - 60-70m radius approx. 140m centre-to-centre. Bright green square is approximate MODIS pixel/Cryosat-2 max resolution. Dark green filled square is 100 x 100m 'survey plot' from SIPEX 2 - drill holes generally occur along at least one side of this square. Light green spots are airborne LiDAR over the survey plot.

                    Drill holes are fun, but generally collect very small 2D samples at disparate locations and times. Sea ice is three dimensional. How do we get that missing dimension and use these labour-intensive data well? Also, how well do altimetry-based estimates match observations?</p>

				    This shows a setup used to create a local coordinate system which drifted with the ice floe being sampled. Using the total station (rear tripod) allowed georeferencing of things on the ice floe. Using data collected by the two GPS units allowed the translation of remote things (aircraft) to the local coordinate system, or vice versa - translation of the ice floe to world coordinates at some point in time.

				    Looking in more detail, we see that there is quite a bit of noise in elevations measured over the oval - which has about a 1cm tall grass cover. So, in this situation which points should we use if we fly over sea ice and want to find water? We'll get to that shortly!

				    To figure out a water surface, we first need to identify points which fall on 'not ice'. This is a two stage process, with an intensity filter selecting green points. This sometimes picks points which lie on ice, but those are always isolated. A neighbourhood size filter is applied, retaining the blue points as canonical 'water'.

				    To estimate snow depth I examined the relationship between snow depth and total freeboard from drill hole observations taken on three research voyages to the East Antarctic pack ice zone - ARISE (2004), SIPEX (2007) and SIPEX II (2012).

				    Each voyage had its unique signature, with a sort of median signal arising when all the data were combined. This 'combined model' was used to estimate snow depth in further analysis. Again, it is imperfect - but the alternatives were passive satellite estimates with known issues over deformed ice, assuming that total freeboard is always a snow signal (also not true), or applying a mean snow depth to all of the LiDAR points (also not true). This is one area that needs further work...

                    For this site, AUV draft and LiDAR draft are strongly correlated if we remove any spatial component and do a simple Spearman's Rho (0.7).</p>
                    <p>
                    This means that <i>most of the time</i> there is thick ice under surface ridges. However, it's also easy to see that modelling ice draft from topography produces artificially deep and narrow ice keels.</p>

                    The spreading of keels below ridges is well known, but rarely directly sampled.</p>

				    <h3>Conclusions, and where to from here?</h3>
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    Using ship-based airborne sensors, we can investigate of sea ice which is too thick to navigate, too thin to walk on, and too far away/logistically difficult to approach using a fixed-wing flown-from-land aircraft</p>
			        </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    For the region studied, in situ observations underestimate ice thickness due to logistically-driven observer bias</p>		    
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    Data quality improvements are simple - funding the work is less straightforward</p>		    
				    </section>
				    <section>
				    <p>
				    <b>This approach is optimised with a well coordinated and mutli-faceted field program</b><br />
				    The airborne observations, ground survey and AUV observations are all interdependent. Take away one and the result is substantially degraded.</p>

				    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
				    <p>
				    Over 4 field campaigns the APPLS instrument collected more than 30&nbsp;000 aerial photos, and hundreds of nautical miles of LiDAR.</p>
				    <p>
				    These lie waiting for a keen analyst!</p>

				    <p>
				    The instruments which captured these data have sat in boxes in a shed since 2012. Re-engineering and certifying a package for flight is not cheap, but not expensive relative to the value of the data they can collect. The lacking component is motivation (and maybe someone waiting for a cheap hasselblad at a disposal auction).</p>
