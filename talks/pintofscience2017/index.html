                        Use your arrow keys to navigate. To follow the presentation in a linear fashion, press down until no more slides appear. Then press your right arrow key to move to the next section, then use your down arrow until you reach the end. Repeat until the end.</p>
                        <p>
                        Skip entire sections using the right arrow key - and navigate backwards using the left arrow and up arrow keys. Slide sections and numbers are at the lower right corner if you are getting lost. Or reload the presentation to reset</p>

                        The work and imagery presented in this talk was all made possible by a small and dedicated research team. I am grateful to Dr Tony Worby, Dr Petra Heil, Dr Jan Lieser and Dr Rob Massom for trusting me to run their logistics programs and field sampling. Dr Christopher Watson implanted too many ideas about geodesy and rigour, and helped to conceive a key sea ice surveying project.</p>
                    <p>
                    Field trips and data collection were supported by the Australian Antarctic Division. Helicopter Resources provided aircraft and very patient pilots, and the crew of the <i>RSV Aurora Australis</i> got us there and back in style.</p>

                        The RAPPLS project (2007-2012) led by Dr Jan Lieser is the largest-scale airborne survey of East Antarctic pack ice to date. It was the basis for my doctoral research, and work continues with a very small team unpicking a vast dataset - more than 30 000 digital images and thousands of kilometres of LiDAR flights.</p>
                        <p>
                        Sea ice field work is hard, demanding and expensive... and always the result of long planning efforts from a dedicated team.</p>

                    Orange circles represent ICESat 'spots' - 60-70m radius approx. 140m centre-to-centre. Bright green square is approximate MODIS pixel/Cryosat-2 max resolution. Dark green filled square is 100 x 100m 'survey plot' from SIPEX 2 - drill holes generally occur along at least one side of this square. Light green spots are airborne LiDAR over the survey plot.
